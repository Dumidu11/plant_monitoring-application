                                                              Introduction
Internet of things can be used to agriculture industry. The Developed countries are still using IoT technology for agriculture. Japan's IoT technology requires very little human labor. As a result, even though the initial cost is higher,
the profit after the lower cost is very high. Drone technology allows countries such as Canada to monitor their crops regularly to minimize crop damage. 
Also, those countries have reaped good benefits by providing chemical fertilizers, water and IoT technology. IoT technology can be used to study crop data and environmental data and analyze that data to control adverse crop residues.
This plant monitoring system monitors the conditions required for a plant to grow well and experiments with IoT technology. This Smart plant monitoring system can be used to the green houses to interior of the greenhouse can be used to observe the required factors from the outside or from anywhere.
The data can be easily analyzed by gathering those factors.

                                                               Targets
• Measure the Temperature, humidity, light-intensity, rain and moisture with date and time.
• Data are saved in the spread sheet and display every 10 seconds
• Temperature, Humidity, Light intensity, Rain and Moisture data will be displayed in android application with date and time. 
And refresh the application automatically upgrade the new data rows.
